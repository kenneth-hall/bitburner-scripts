# Purpose

Learning exercise, not a normal project: help the user **learn Claude Code** —
prompting, workflow, effective use — with **Bitburner** as the sandbox. Implement
what's asked (not hints-only). **Proactively coach** on Claude Code usage/prompting
as an ongoing relationship. Don't cheat by reading/adapting other players' Bitburner
solutions — work from game mechanics and the API.

## Development workflow
Feature work runs in three stages, each handing off a **file**, not chat. Name phase docs
`phase-NN-slug.<stage>.md` — zero-padded number first so they sort chronologically (e.g.
`phase-15-homeram.features.md`, `phase-15-homeram.spec.md`). The active phase's docs live in
the repo root during the work; when it ships, they graduate to `docs/phases/` and a condensed,
dated entry goes in `docs/phases/CHANGELOG.md`.
1. **Brainstorm (opus)** → `phase-NN-slug.features.md` (decisions, rejected alternatives, open questions).
2. **Spec + review (fable)** → `phase-NN-slug.spec.md`, then a cold-context review by the
   `spec-reviewer` subagent; address blockers, log disagreements as open questions.
   Present final draft + changelog + open questions before implementing.
3. **Implement (sonnet)** on a branch/worktree, with the tests / RAM gate /
   `npm run verify:log` / live validation the spec calls for.

Conventions below apply at every stage (spec-reviewer enforces them).

## Engineering conventions
- **Keep Singularity calls out of hot paths** — heavy RAM multiplier. Isolate in
  daemon-launched companion scripts `exec`'d by filename (like `purchasescripts.js`),
  never imported into `daemon.js`.
- **Log every purchase** via `recordTransaction` (`src/translog.js`) on success — see
  existing call sites. A failed spend records nothing.
- **Test + validate against logs** — vitest where practical, check exported logs, wire
  into `npm run verify:log`. For live-only behavior, do a live run and say so.
- **Prefer exported logs over pasted terminal output** (game copy/paste is lossy). Verify
  against the log files, not assumption. If a result isn't logged, add an `ns.write(...)`
  export (+ `vite.config.ts` filter) instead of asking for a paste — or ask whether to log
  it. → `docs/logging.md` for the file-naming patterns.
- **Never `git checkout`/switch branches in the dev-server-watched checkout while the game
  is connected**, unless the push is intended — viteburner pushes on every working-tree
  change, so a checkout mid-merge silently overwrites the in-game code with whatever the old
  branch held (caused Phase 13's phantom RAM bug: three "confirmed" gate re-runs all measured
  stale reverted files). Stop `npm run dev` first for merge choreography. Any RAM-gate reading
  is only trustworthy if it's checked against `dist/src/*`'s byte-faithful record of what was
  actually last pushed (`ramcheck.js` records each script's in-game byte length for exactly
  this).
- **Only Claude working in `bitburner-scripts` (this checkout) may stop `npm run dev`.** It's
  the one running the live dev server pushing to the game. A Claude session in a different
  worktree (e.g. `bitburner-scripts2`) must never stop/restart it — that server isn't visible
  or under that session's control, and killing another session's process out from under it
  breaks the user's in-game sync without warning.
- **Dev-server connection auto-heals on session start.** The game/daemon survives the
  computer sleeping fine (scripts keep running), but `npm run dev`'s WebSocket connection
  to it (port 12525) doesn't reconnect cleanly, so exported logs silently go stale. A
  `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/hooks/dev-server-autoheal.sh`, wired in the gitignored
  `.claude/settings.local.json` — never `bitburner-scripts2`) checks
  `logs/daemon-batch-log.json`'s mtime every session start; past 60s stale (or the dev
  server isn't running at all) it kills+restarts `npm run dev` automatically and reports
  one line. No manual "is my computer asleep" debugging should be needed anymore.

## Tracking work
Check `BACKLOG.md` before starting; keep it current (In Progress / Next Up / Ideas). On
completion, move a dated, condensed entry to `docs/phases/CHANGELOG.md` — keep history out
of BACKLOG. **Update as part of the work, not after** — stage the BACKLOG/CHANGELOG edit in
the same commit as the change it describes, so it doesn't become a separate git cycle.

## Communication
- **Summarize after acting.**
- **Flag unplanned deviations** (extra changes, moved/deleted files, scope creep, a
  different approach) — don't fold them in silently.

## Worktrees
`bitburner-scripts2` (sibling folder, branch `worktree-docs`) is a second worktree for
brainstorming, `BACKLOG.md`/docs edits, and phase-doc drafting — work there when you want to
touch documentation without risking the live checkout. It has no dev server of its own; it
must never start or stop `npm run dev` (see the engineering-conventions rule above). Merge its
branch back to `master` like any other worktree when the docs work is ready.

**Sync from `master` before touching anything phase work might have changed.** Phase work
(fixes, close-outs) lands directly on `master` in the main worktree — `worktree-docs` never sees
it automatically, only via merge. Before reading or editing `BACKLOG.md` or any doc that phase
work might touch, run `git merge master` in this worktree first — not just once at session start,
since phase work can land on `master` mid-session too. This worktree normally carries no commits
of its own that `master` doesn't already have, so it's a clean fast-forward, not a real merge.
Skipping this risks brainstorming/planning against stale state — e.g. re-flagging a bug that
already shipped a fix.

**This checkout (`bitburner-scripts`) needs the same check in reverse.** Worktrees share one
`.git` object database and branch refs, but not working-tree state — a commit `worktree-docs`
makes straight to `master` (valid whenever `master` isn't checked out here, e.g. mid-phase-branch
work) updates this checkout's `master` ref immediately, yet stays invisible until `master` is
actually checked out again. Before merging a finished phase branch back to `master`, run
`git log master` (or `git log HEAD..master` from the branch) to check for anything that landed
there from `worktree-docs` since the branch was cut — a normal `git merge` folds it in safely
either way, this is just so a docs-only commit from the other worktree doesn't go unnoticed.

## Git
Use version control: branch off `master`, commit, and merge your own work in interactive
sessions — no need to ask.
- **Ship gate:** a change with nothing to validate (docs, comments, text) can be
  committed/pushed/merged freely. A change whose spec/request carries a testable requirement
  (`npm test`, a RAM gate, `npm run verify:log`, a live run) ships only after that validation
  passes — then no further sign-off is needed. RAM/log/live checks depend on Kenneth's in-game
  run, so those changes wait on his validation; `npm test` I can run and clear myself.
- **Safety rail:** background/autonomous job sessions can't push or merge to `master` (enforced by
  execution mode) — prep the branch/PR and let Kenneth merge.

## Off-limits & sources
- Allowed sources: local game files, API docs in `markdown/` (**check first**), the
  official Bitburner GitHub repo.
- **Don't read game source to shortcut the puzzle** — docs/API fine, source-diving not.
- **Don't skip ahead or spoil progression** — help only with what's currently unlocked.
  **Carve-out:** static numbers/tables (costs, RAM, prices) are fine to look up.

## Task-specific detail
See `docs/INDEX.md` for on-demand references (logging patterns, dev-server / Remote API).

**Docs layout:** `docs/` — Bitburner project/task references · `docs/metareference/` —
non-Bitburner learning material (Claude Code / AI-workflow docs) · `docs/phases/` — archived
shipped phase docs (index: `CHANGELOG.md`).
