# Backlog

Tracks feature work and goals across sessions. Update when starting/finishing something;
move finished items to Done with a date instead of deleting them.

## In Progress

- **Batcher refactor Phase 9 — Phase 8 close-out** (2026-07-04): `batcher-refactor-phase9.md`.
  All three `[code]` work items shipped and verified locally; the two `[live]` steps (RAM gate,
  clean A/B/A' income session) still need Kenneth in-game — see Next Up for those.
  - **Status as of 2026-07-04, mid-session, picking back up here**: code is done and PR #3
    (`worktree-phase9-closeout` → `master`) is open, **not yet merged**. RAM gate's "before"
    half is done (see the RAM gate item in Next Up for the numbers). Remaining, in order: (1)
    merge PR #3 and pull `master` into the main checkout so viteburner has the new files, (2)
    confirm sync, restart `daemon.js` in-game, (3) RAM gate "after" measurement, (4) the clean
    A/B/A' session, (5) close out this item and the two Next Up items it unblocks with the
    final numbers.
  - **Aside, unblocked mid-session**: found and fixed a stale viteburner Remote API connection
    (socket showed `ESTABLISHED` on port 12525 but was actually dead — a fresh dev-server
    restart immediately logged `disconnected`). Killed and restarted `npm run dev`; Kenneth
    reconnected the Remote API in-game. Not a Phase 9 code issue, just dev-loop friction —
    matches the pattern already flagged in the two viteburner items further down this file.
  - **`pickBatchSet`'s pass-3/pass-4 both-lists bug — fixed.** Added a `justEvicted` set
    (`scheduler.js`) filled inside pass 3's displacement commit; pass 4's refill loop now skips
    any candidate in it, so a server evicted this tick can't be re-admitted in the same call (it
    becomes eligible again next tick as an ordinary non-incumbent). BACKLOG's exact repro
    (challenger/mid/n00dles, budget 35, hysteresis 1.25) now returns `members == ['challenger']`
    with both `mid` and `n00dles` in `exits` as `displaced` and zero overlap — confirmed via a
    plain-node import, not just the test suite. 3 new `test/scheduler.test.js` cases (the repro,
    an explicit never-evicted-candidate refill case, and an `expectNoOverlap` helper applied to
    the repro plus all 5 pre-existing displacement-path cases); all 15 pre-fix `pickBatchSet`
    cases still pass unchanged.
  - **RAM rename `share` → `sharePool`, shipped in code; live gate still pending.** Renamed the
    identifier/property in `sampling.js`'s `inFlightByTarget` (`{byTarget, share}` →
    `{byTarget, sharePool}`), `daemon.js` (`preTickInFlight.sharePool.*`, snapshot key `share:` →
    `sharePool:`), and `sharecurve.js` (`sweep.sharePool.threads`) — the only construct in the
    import graph that exactly matched `ns.share`'s name (2.4 GB, `markdown/bitburner.ns.share.md`).
    `sharePool` re-verified absent from `NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts`. `share.js` itself (the real
    `ns.share()` call), `SHARE_SCRIPT`, `SHARE_FRACTION`, and `sharePower` (a different identifier,
    doesn't collide) are untouched by design. **This is a deliberate log-schema change** — noted
    in `daemon.js`'s log header comment; old exported logs need a checker version from before this
    commit to validate (git history), the current checker validates only the `sharePool` schema.
    Still needs Kenneth's before/after `ramcheck.js` gate to confirm the hypothesis
    (`daemon.js` expected ≈16.30 GB after, down from 18.70) — see Next Up.
  - **`hackingLevel` added to snapshots, `dropPreConfigStragglers` and `checkNaturalExit`
    extracted.** `daemon.js`'s snapshot record gains `hackingLevel: ns.getHackingLevel()` (+0.00
    measured RAM expected — already charged once via `hosts.js`/`targets.js`'s existing calls,
    per the once-per-name import-charging model); checker validates it and a soft report prints
    first/last/min/max/delta. New pure helper `dropPreConfigStragglers(entries)` in
    `test/verify-log-checks.js` slices a log to its first retained `mode` event, wired into
    `verify-log.test.js`'s `beforeAll` behind `VERIFY_SLICE_STRAGGLERS=1` (opt-in, so a normal
    single-window log validates in full by default). The natural-exit invariant, previously
    inline `expect` calls in `verify-log.test.js`, is now `checkNaturalExit(entries)` in
    `verify-log-checks.js`, matching the style of the other three extracted checks, with new
    fixture tests in `test/checker-fixtures.test.js` modeled on the real Phase 8 failure.
  - **`npm test` green at 128/128** (up from Phase 8's 120/120: +6 scheduler, +2 sampling
    (`sharePool` shape), +6 checker-fixtures (`checkNaturalExit` x3, `dropPreConfigStragglers`
    x3)).
  - **Implementation-time validation against the real `logs/phase8-ab/` copies (one-off script,
    not committed): exact match to the spec's expected table.** `checkNaturalExit` violations:
    0/0/31/114/114 across the five copies, in order — identical to the numbers that motivated
    this phase. `Aprime-end`'s fraction-consistency: 15 violations unsliced (stragglers, no
    preceding `mode` event) → 0 sliced via `dropPreConfigStragglers`, which kept exactly 1757 of
    2000 entries (first `mode` event at index 243) — matches the spec's prediction exactly. (Old
    logs use the pre-rename `share` key; the one-off script translated it to `sharePool` before
    calling the checker, since a real post-rename session log wouldn't need this — see the
    schema-change note above.)
  - Branch `worktree-phase9-closeout`.

## Next Up

- **Phase 9 RAM gate — before half done, after half still needed** (2026-07-04): the
  `share`→`sharePool` rename is shipped in code (PR #3, not yet merged). **"Before" measurement
  taken 2026-07-04, pre-Phase-9 code**: `run ramcheck.js daemon.js share.js targets.js` →
  `daemon.js: 18.7 GB | share.js: 4 GB | targets.js: 12.65 GB` — exact match on the first two
  (18.70/4.00 expected); `targets.js`'s 12.65 GB is the new before-reference for the
  bundle-vs-reachability question (no prior baseline existed). **Still needed**: merge PR #3,
  pull `master` in the main checkout, confirm viteburner syncs, restart `daemon.js` in-game,
  then re-run the same `ramcheck.js` command for the "after" numbers. Decision tree: `daemon.js`
  ≈16.30 GB → collision hypothesis confirmed; unchanged 18.70 → falsified, run the fallback
  `ramtest-e*.js` matrix from the spec; anything else → partially confirmed, same fallback.
  `targets.js` dropping by 2.4 from 12.65 means bundle/whole-file charging; unchanged means
  reachability-based.

- **Phase 8/9 tuning follow-up: get a clean A/B/A' session** (2026-07-04, carried from Phase 8,
  now unblocked). This needs the pass-4 fix above (done) and the RAM gate above (run first, per
  spec ordering) before Kenneth runs the live session: three ≥10-minute windows (share
  off/on/off), fleet frozen, one calendar day, `VERIFY_WINDOWS`/`npm run verify:log` on each
  boundary copy (with `VERIFY_SLICE_STRAGGLERS=1` if a copy hard-fails on a missing preceding
  `mode` event). Required output: windowed $/min for A/B/A' with each window's `hackingLevel`
  drift (now auto-reported per the snapshot addition above) next to it, and a keep/raise/lower
  recommendation for `SHARE_FRACTION`. Phase 8's rep-side result (2.78 vs 1.92 rep/sec,
  ~45% boost) already stands and isn't re-measured.

- **RAM-analyzer identifier hygiene** (2026-07-04, filed from the Phase 9 investigation): the
  same exact-name-collision mechanism that caused the `share`/`ns.share` 2.4 GB phantom charge
  likely also applies to `WORKER_SCRIPTS`' keys — `hack`/`grow`/`weaken` (`scheduler.js`) match
  `ns.hack`/`ns.grow`/`ns.weaken`'s names exactly, which would mean every importer of
  `WORKER_SCRIPTS` has been paying a phantom 0.1 + 0.15 + 0.15 = 0.4 GB since Phase 2. Verifiable
  with the same E-matrix technique (`batcher-refactor-phase9.md`'s fallback diagnostic plan) —
  object keys, not standalone identifiers, so worth confirming object-literal-key charging
  specifically before assuming it applies. Renaming `WORKER_SCRIPTS`' keys is a wider refactor
  than this phase's scope (touches every `WORKER_SCRIPTS[...]` call site across `scheduler.js`,
  `daemon.js`, `sampling.js`) — not started.

- **targetsmonitor "ratio" column → actual priority metric**: Investigated a suspected bug
  (2026-07-04) — "ratio" numbers looked suspiciously round/inconsistent, hypothesis was that
  purchased-but-uninstalled augmentations were leaking in. No bug found: `ratio`
  (`targets.js:92`, `maxMoney / minSecurityLevel`) is purely server-intrinsic, fixed at
  world-gen, with no player-derived input in the formula at all — confirmed against the code
  and against `installAugmentations`'s docs (aug effects apply only on install/reset, never
  on purchase), so neither a hacking level-up nor an uninstalled aug can move it. The real
  driver of "these numbers changed": `getTargets()` sorts by `score` (money-per-GB-second,
  the actual ranking metric) while the display only ever showed the unrelated `ratio` field
  — a level-up reshuffles which targets appear/rank, moving rows around even though no
  individual server's ratio value changes.
  - **Decided**: stop displaying `ratio`; show `t.score` instead, labeled `priority`, using
    the `toExponential(2)` rendering `targets.js` already uses for score so the two displays
    read consistently. Apply to both `targetsmonitor.js`'s live dashboard (replace the
    `ratio` column) and `targets.js`'s own `main()` summary (drop the `(ratio ...)`
    parenthetical — score is already printed first).
  - **Also decided (from the withdrawn Phase 5 draft)**: remove the `ratio` field from the
    target objects `getTargets` builds. Grep confirmed (2026-07-04) its only consumers are
    `targetsmonitor.js:57` and `targets.js:147` (`sampling.js:330`'s `ratio` is an unrelated
    local; the daemon log and verify-log never touch the field). This changes the
    `targets-summary-*.json` schema — note it in the file's comment. If a third consumer
    turns up at implementation, keep the field and flag it instead.
  - **Also decided**: fix the misleading `->` marker in `targetsmonitor.js` — it claims the
    top-ranked entry is `daemon.js`'s current batch target, which is wrong under
    `RANK_HYSTERESIS` (the incumbent can sit below rank 0 — `daemon.js`'s own `lowerTargets`
    comment documents this exact trap). The monitor can't see the daemon's incumbent without
    coupling to it, so make the display honest: relabel the marker "top-ranked by score" and
    add a one-line legend noting the daemon's actual target can differ under hysteresis.
    **Post-Phase-7 update (2026-07-04)**: there's no longer a single "incumbent" — the legend
    text should say "the daemon's active *set* can differ" instead of "the daemon's actual
    target can differ." Leave the actual text edit for this item's own implementation.
  - Verification: run `targetsmonitor.js` and `targets.js` in-game, eyeball both against a
    `targets-summary` export; `npm test` stays green (no unit-tested code changes).

- **Consistency consolidation** (from the 2026-07-04 code audit; was item 3 of the original
  Phase 5 draft — full-consolidation depth chosen explicitly; behavior-preserving throughout,
  with the RAM gate and a before/after daemon session as the safety net). Do this *before*
  the backdoor item below — it extracts `tryRoot` and `findPath`, which the backdoor script
  imports.
  - **New shared module `src/common.js`** — charter (state it in the header): ns-dependent
    helpers shared by multiple scripts; no policy decisions, no batching math; keep the ns
    surface minimal and cheap (`scan`, `tprint`, `getScriptRam` — every importer's bundle
    pays for all of it; nothing `ns.cloud.*` or Singularity). Contents: `scanNetwork(ns)`
    (BFS copy-pasted identically in `hosts.js`/`targets.js`/`killscripts.js` — move verbatim,
    rewire all three); `findPath(ns, target)` (BFS parent-chain walk from `connect.js`);
    `tprintTs(ns, message)` (from `daemon.js`; also use it for `hosts.js`'s rooted-host
    notification, which currently fires mid-daemon-run with no timestamp); `workerRamCosts(ns)`
    (the three-script `getScriptRam` map built in both `daemon.js`'s `refreshCycle` and
    `targets.js`'s `getTargets`; takes `WORKER_SCRIPTS` from `scheduler.js`).
  - **`hosts.js` restructure**: export `HOME_RESERVE_GB` (`daemon.js` imports it, deletes its
    private copy). Split `getHosts` into `tryRoot(ns, server)` (the PORT_OPENERS/nuke block,
    returns whether the server ended up rooted) and `listHosts(ns)` (pure listing, no rooting
    side effects); `getHosts` composes the two, exact current behavior. Switch
    `launchmonitor.js` to `listHosts` — its "fully read-only" header is false today because
    `getHosts` nukes newly-rootable servers from inside a monitor, racing the daemon's
    refresh; after the switch, update the header to say it deliberately uses the non-rooting
    variant. (Correctness fix, not a RAM fix — bundle charging means it already paid.)
  - **`daemon.js` internal cleanup**: factor the identical 10-line free-RAM-check preamble
    out of `launchDetached`/`runAndWait` into one local helper (make the skip message
    call-site-neutral). Fix `runAndWait`'s docstring — it narrates
    `purchasescripts.js`/`upgradehomeram.js` but its only call site is `killscripts.js`.
    ~~Move `sumInFlightRam`/`countBatchesInFlight` into `sampling.js` next to their sibling
    `countInFlightThreads`, with unit tests in `test/sampling.test.js` reusing the
    `inFlightPs` fixture style.~~ **Superseded by Phase 7 (2026-07-04, see Done below)**:
    shipped as `inFlightByTarget`, a single combined `ns.ps` sweep rather than a straight
    move of the two separate functions — don't redo this sub-item.
  - **Small consolidations and comment fixes**: `cloudcosts.js` exports the power-of-2
    `standardSizes` builder, `purchasecloudservers.js` imports it (lives in cloudcosts, not
    common.js, to keep `ns.cloud.*` out of common importers' bundles). Header fixes:
    `purchasescripts.js` (drop the false "daemon runs this at startup" claim),
    `killscripts.js` (daemon doesn't kill in steady state — one-shot workers exit on their
    own). (`fleetupgrade.js`'s header reclassification shipped early with Phase 5, since that
    phase made it a permanent transactions-log call site — see Done below.)
  - **Dead files (decided: delete both)**: `src/cleanup-old-daemon-log-temp.js` (run-once,
    job done) and the root-level `cloud-server-costs.js` (older duplicate of
    `src/cloudcosts.js`, never synced by viteburner). Also `rm` in-game copies where
    applicable — viteburner won't delete them.
  - Verification: `npm test` green including the new in-flight-scanner tests; RAM gate
    (`getScriptRam` before/after) for `daemon.js`, `targets.js`, `hosts.js`,
    `killscripts.js`, `connect.js`, `launchmonitor.js`, `targetsmonitor.js` — expect ~flat;
    ≥15-minute daemon session after, `npm run verify:log` green, same character as Phase 4's
    acceptance runs; the transactions log (Phase 5) should show income unchanged in
    character too.

- **Post-reset auto-backdoor for joinable factions**: after an augmentation install (which
  resets hacking level and, per the user, the eligibility state for these invites), auto-check
  which faction-invite backdoor targets we now qualify for (not yet joined that faction, and
  hacking level high enough to reach/root their server) and install the backdoor as soon as
  eligible. Named targets so far: CyberSec (`CSEC`) and NiteSec (`avmnite-02h`) — scoped to
  exactly these two for now, more can be added later without spoiling anything not yet reached.
  Clarified (2026-07-04): runs standalone *after* a reset (not pre-reset prep); backdoor only,
  no auto-`joinFaction`; should be wired in as a companion process launched from `daemon.js`'s
  startup (same pattern as `targetsmonitor.js`/`transactionsmonitor.js`), not inlined into
  `daemon.js`'s own file — its Singularity calls (`connect`/`installBackdoor`/`getCurrentServer`)
  carry the same RAM multiplier without SF4 that `daemon.js` already avoids for
  `purchasescripts.js`/`upgradehomeram.js`.
  - **Reverted 2026-07-04**: a `backdoorfactions.js` companion was implemented and wired into
    `daemon.js`, then reverted at the user's request — mid-testing, this chat is for request
    tracking only, not implementation. Design above reflects what was decided/built before the
    revert, kept here so a future implementation doesn't have to re-derive it.
  - **Implemented and reverted again, 2026-07-04**: a full implementation shipped as
    `batcher-refactor-phase6.md` (`common.js`, `eventlog.js`, `factionwatcher.js`,
    `backdoorfactions.js`, plus the `hosts.js`/`connect.js`/`daemon.js` wiring described
    below), then fully reverted the same day at the user's request — they judged it not
    worth further development right now after realizing they'd misunderstood some of the
    underlying game mechanics (notably: they don't currently have Singularity access
    unlocked, and had assumed some factions could be safely auto-joined with no downside).
    None of this is implemented; treat every item on this backlog entry as still to do.
    Reverted via `git revert` (history preserved, not rewritten) — see
    `batcher-refactor-phase6.md`'s status note for the full file/commit list before
    resuming, and re-confirm the settled decisions below still hold given the
    Singularity-access correction.
  - Existing scaffolding to reuse: `connect.js` already BFS-pathfinds to a target (its
    `DEFAULT_TARGET` is already `"CSEC"`) but only prints the path — needs adapting to actually
    drive `ns.singularity.connect()` hop by hop. `hosts.js`'s `PORT_OPENERS`/nuke logic can be
    reused to root the target first if it isn't already. **Depends on the consolidation item
    above** for the `tryRoot` and `findPath` extractions.
  - **Behavior (from the withdrawn Phase 5 draft, settled)**: per target on a
    `POLL_MS = 60_000` loop — done conditions that skip permanently (backdoor already
    installed, check the server object's backdoor field, verify exact name in
    `markdown\bitburner.server.md`; or faction already joined via `ns.getPlayer().factions`);
    eligibility (hacking level ≥ required, root available or `tryRoot` succeeds); action
    (root if needed, walk `findPath` hop by hop via `ns.singularity.connect` — verify its
    adjacency semantics — sanity-check location with `getCurrentServer` before
    `await ns.singularity.installBackdoor()`, `tprintTs` each install); **exit when every
    target is done**, freeing its Singularity-sized RAM. `killscripts.js` sweeps it on daemon
    restart; relaunch is idempotent because every action re-checks state first.
  - **Open decisions from the 2026-07-04 spec review, settle at implementation**:
    (a) *Launch-retry gap* — post-reset home RAM is smallest exactly when this script matters
    most, so `launchDetached`'s INFO-skip could mean it never launches until the next daemon
    restart, days later. Decide: slow daemon-side relaunch retry (exec-by-filename adds no
    RAM to the daemon) vs. a skip message that explicitly tells the user to run it manually
    once RAM allows. (b) *Terminal hijack* — `singularity.connect` moves the player's
    terminal connection; a background loop that yanks you off a server mid-manual-session and
    dumps you at `home` is a live-play irritant. Decide: save `getCurrentServer` at loop
    start and restore *that* after installing, or accept and document.
  - Verification: runnable now against the current save (targets likely already
    joined/backdoored — confirm actual save state first; it must tprint its skip reasoning
    once per target and exit cleanly, with daemon startup wiring undisturbed and
    `npm run verify:log` green). The real end-to-end (level up → root → connect-walk →
    backdoor → exit) is structurally deferred to the next reset — record as a
    live-validation follow-up when built, same as the waived fleetupgrade test.

## Ideas / Backlog

- **Stock market — no design yet, mechanics straightened out for future design pass**
  (2026-07-04): No architecture decided; this is a mechanics reference to design against
  later, not a spec. Current save state: TIX API access purchased, no WSE account, no 4S
  data (matches [[bitburner_stock_market_progress]] memory).
  - **Two independent access doors, not a read/write split**: WSE account gates *manual*
    trading via the in-game Stock Market UI; TIX API access gates *scripted* trading via
    `ns.stock`. Each door covers both reading and trading for its own method — it's method
    (UI vs script) that's gated, not action (read vs buy/sell). You can hold either without
    the other, which is why scripted trading should already work despite no WSE account.
  - **4S Market Data is a premium add-on layered on top of whichever method you use**:
    `getForecast`/`getVolatility` return per-stock probability-of-rise and max per-tick
    swing — the actual trading edge. Gated by its own purchase: `purchase4SMarketDataTixApi()`
    for scripts (needs TIX API access, not WSE — a money gate, affordable now) vs.
    `purchase4SMarketData()` for the UI (needs WSE account). Separate from the base
    read/trade doors above.
  - **Progression-locked, not purchasable at all yet**: `placeOrder`/`cancelOrder`/`getOrders`
    (limit/stop orders) and `buyShort`/`sellShort` (short selling) — their docs say "unlocked
    later in the game," no purchase function exists for them.
  - **Doc inconsistency flagged, not yet resolved empirically**: `getPrice()` and
    `getOrganization()`'s docs list "WSE Account" as a requirement even for the scripted
    call, which contradicts `purchaseTixApi()`'s own doc ("you can buy TIX API access
    without a WSE account") and the fact that other read/trade calls (`getSymbols`,
    `buyStock`, `sellStock`, etc.) don't mention any WSE requirement. Worth testing directly
    in-game (e.g. `ns.stock.getPrice(ns.stock.getSymbols()[0])`) next time stock market work
    picks up, since it decides whether scripted reads already work today.
  - **Not yet decided, needs a real design pass before any code**: any actual trading
    strategy/script — nothing built yet, this entry is purely the access-mechanics
    reference gathered via docs + discussion this session.

- **Darknet exploitation — no architecture yet, mechanics captured for future design pass**
  (2026-07-04): Kenneth has a working mental model of how the darknet (`ns.dnet`) behaves,
  from discussion + docs in `markdown/bitburner.darknet*.md`, but no design/architecture
  decided. This entry is a mechanics reference to design against later, not a spec.
  - **Access/lifecycle chain**: `probe(returnByIP)` / `isDarknetServer(host)` /
    `getServerDetails(host)` to discover and inspect; `heartbleed(host)` to read logs and
    diagnose failed auth; `authenticate(host, password)` (direct-connect only) or
    `connectToSession(host, password)` (any distance, once already authenticated) to get a
    session; `setStasisLink(true)` / `freezeServer(host)` to hold a foothold against churn
    (`getStasisLinkLimit()` caps how many links can be active globally at once).
  - **Network volatility (the mechanic normal-network scripts don't have to deal with)**:
    `nextMutation()` ticks the whole darknet on its own clock — each cycle, some servers can
    move (breaks/reforms connections only, script likely survives), go offline (usually
    permanent, script and access gone), restart (kills all running scripts on that server), or
    a new server can appear. `getDarknetInstability()` is a cost/budget gate tied to
    backdooring activity — **open question, not yet checked in-game: is this global or
    per-server?** Matters for whether "throw more workers at it" has a hidden ceiling.
  - **Three extraction paths, not mutually exclusive**: (1) RAM — `getBlockedRam(host)` (free,
    0 GB) to check upside, then `memoryReallocation(host)` (needs auth + direct connection) to
    free usable RAM, scales with charisma/threads. (2) Money — `phishingAttack()` (must run
    *on* the darknet server, no target arg), scales with threads/charisma/crime success rate,
    very occasionally drops a `.cache` file as a bonus; `openCache(filename)` cashes it in
    (2 GB, costs karma). Caches are **not** a standing resource to seek out directly — the docs
    only describe them dropping from phishing, so this is "grab it when it appears," not a
    plannable target. (3) Stock — `promoteStock(sym)` needs no server access at all, just a
    symbol; raises a stock's *volatility* (not its forecast), decays without reapplication, and
    is only useful if paired with actual trading (see stock market unlock state in
    [[bitburner_stock_market_progress]] memory — 4S Market Data feed not active yet, blocked on
    WSE Account, so `promoteStock` has no trading strategy to pair with today).
  - **Karma**: `CrimeStats.karma` and `CacheReward.karmaLoss` both use "loss" terminology, and
    documented faction karma requirements are negative thresholds (e.g. `{ "type": "karma",
    "karma": -90 }` meaning karma must be ≤ -90) — read together, this suggests both crime and
    cache-opening push karma the same (more negative) direction that low-karma faction
    eligibility wants, i.e. no real tension between "open caches freely" and "keep karma low
    enough for some factions." **Not yet confirmed empirically** — cheap to verify with
    `ns.getPlayer().karma` before/after opening one cache.
  - **Prerequisite work**: the "Consistency consolidation" item above (new `src/common.js` with
    `scanNetwork`/`findPath`/`tryRoot`/etc.) should land first so darknet scripts can reuse
    those helpers instead of re-deriving BFS/rooting logic a second time.
  - **Not yet decided, needs a real design pass before any code**: scheduling model for
    volatile/moving targets (very different from the normal-network batcher's static-topology
    assumption), which of the three extraction paths to prioritize per server/situation, how to
    represent/react to `nextMutation()` events, and whether/how this integrates with or runs
    alongside `daemon.js`.

- **viteburner dev-server silently stops auto-exporting** (2026-07-04): during Phase 5 live
  verification, the `npm run dev` process had been running continuously for 2+ hours (no
  crash, no error output) but stopped producing fresh downloads to `logs/` at some point —
  `daemon-batch-log.json` and the transactions file both stopped updating even though
  `daemon.js` kept running and writing in-game. A full restart of the dev server fixed it
  (clean reconnect, full re-sync). Root cause not confirmed — one candidate: this process's
  stdin isn't a TTY ("`current stdin is not a TTY. Keypress events may not work`" at startup),
  and the auto-export mechanism (`vite.config.ts`'s `autoExportDaemonLog` plugin) works by
  synthetically emitting a `keypress` event on `process.stdin`, which may not survive a
  websocket reconnect cleanly in a non-TTY process. Not investigated further this session —
  worth digging into if it recurs, since a restart is an easy workaround but an unnoticed
  stall could look like "no income landing" when it's actually "not exporting."

- **Investigate auto-reconnecting the Remote API after a dev-server restart** (2026-07-04):
  confirmed live during Phase 8 verification — recovering from the auto-export stall above
  requires killing and restarting `npm run dev`, which always drops the game's Remote API
  connection; nothing re-syncs (and `daemon.js` can't be picked up with new code) until it's
  manually reconnected in-game (Options → Remote API). Worth checking whether viteburner or
  the underlying Remote API protocol supports a reconnect-on-restart or keep-alive mode, so a
  dev-server restart doesn't cost a manual in-game step every time. Distinct from the item
  above: that one is the export-polling mechanism silently dying while the connection stays
  up; this one is the connection itself needing a human to re-establish it after any restart.

- **Claude Code workflow blocker: getting a screenshot into a terminal session** (2026-07-04):
  when debugging a live in-game error, copy/pasting the terminal text came through garbled/
  incomplete (same lossiness `CLAUDE.md`'s log-export rule already calls out for terminal
  copy/paste in general), so we fell back to a screenshot — but `Ctrl+V`-pasting a Snip &
  Sketch capture directly into the Claude Code terminal input didn't attach anything, and a
  saved file at a guessed path (Desktop/Downloads/Pictures/the worktree) wasn't found either.
  Not a Bitburner item — revisit once we land on a reliable method (probably: save the file,
  then hand Claude the exact path so it reads it directly) and write the steps down so future
  sessions aren't rediscovering this each time.

- **Claude Code workflow to learn: automating the spec-review loop** (2026-07-04): designed in
  chat; using the prompt-only version for now (main session writes the spec since it holds the
  requirements context, a cold-context subagent peer-reviews it, main session addresses blocking
  issues and presents final draft + changelog + open questions for approval). Two automation
  levels to build/learn when ready:
  - **Level 1 — reviewer subagent**: `.claude/agents/spec-reviewer.md` (YAML frontmatter +
    markdown body that becomes its system prompt). Fixed rubric: review against the stated
    requirements; flag ambiguity, missing edge cases, untestable acceptance criteria, hidden
    assumptions. Read-only tools (`tools: Read, Glob, Grep`). Required verdict format: APPROVE
    or a numbered list of blocking issues only.
  - **Level 2 — `/spec` skill**: `.claude/skills/spec/SKILL.md` encoding the whole loop (write
    spec to `specs/<name>.md` → delegate review to spec-reviewer → address blocking issues,
    anything disputed becomes an open question → present draft/changelog/open questions → wait
    for approval before implementing).
  - Deliberately rejected: multi-round author↔reviewer convergence (no natural stopping point;
    rubber-stamp and invented-nitpick failure modes). One review round; a manually requested
    second pass is the escalation valve, and unresolved disagreements go to Kenneth as open
    questions rather than forced consensus.

- **Monitor cleanup + more meaningful logging**: `daemon.js`'s tail popup is very verbose
  and some numbers look stale or reset next cycle — concretely: the `durations:` line reads
  `batchTarget.hackTime/growTime/weakenTime`, only refreshed in `refreshCycle()` (up to
  `CYCLE_MS`/10s stale vs. the rest of the popup's `BATCH_INTERVAL_MS` redraw); and the
  `batch #N` block always shows `lastBatch`, which persists from whenever the last real
  launch happened, with no cue when it's not this tick's launch. Wants an out-of-game
  (maybe live) dashboard. Candidate logs discussed (2026-07-04) — the $ transactions log
  idea has since shipped as Phase 5 (see Done below); remaining open ideas:
  - ~~**RAM utilization time series**: `utilization` is computed every tick in `daemon.js` but
    only displayed, never logged as its own series — needed for a dashboard chart.~~
    **Shipped by Phase 7 (2026-07-04, see Done below)** as `snapshot` log events
    (`utilizationPct`, `memberCount`, per-member breakdown, once per `CYCLE_MS`) — the
    verbosity half of this item is also addressed by Phase 7's tail-popup redesign; the
    out-of-game dashboard half stays open here.
  - **Per-target income/efficiency log**: `batch` events log expected steal but nothing
    closes the loop on realized money per target over time, to sanity-check the ranking
    score against real outcomes.
  - **Prep-cycle duration log**: how long each drift→prepped transition actually takes;
    currently only visible live in the popup's prep-dispatched lines and lost once prepped.

## Done (recent)

- **Batcher refactor Phase 8 — faction share allocation** (2026-07-04): `batcher-refactor-phase8.md`.
  Builds the "`ns.share()` script + dedicated RAM allocation" item into a hard carve:
  `SHARE_FRACTION = 0.25` (untuned by design, see spec) of `totalAllocatableRam` is
  unconditionally reserved for `share.js` (a one-cycle `ns.share()` worker, topped up every
  tick by `planShareTopUp` in `scheduler.js`, smallest-free-RAM-first — opposite end from
  `carveReservation`'s largest-first, so share consumes fragments and leaves contiguous blocks
  for batching's grow jobs); the batch admission budget becomes `(1 - SHARE_FRACTION) x
  totalAllocatableRam`. Zero `ns.kill` call sites (natural-exit philosophy, matching Phase 7) —
  scaling down just means stopping the top-up and letting the pool decay over ~10s. Runtime
  toggle: a 0-byte `share-off.txt` marker on home forces the fraction to 0 for same-session A/B
  measurement. `sampling.js`'s `inFlightByTarget` gained a breaking shape change
  (`{byTarget, share}`) to fold share's sweep into the existing two-sweeps-per-tick budget
  rather than adding a third. New manual tuning script `src/sharecurve.js` (formulas-gated)
  predicts the sharePower curve across candidate fractions, exported to
  `logs/sharecurve-<epoch ms>.json`. Branch `worktree-phase8-share`, draft PR #1, not yet
  merged (pending a merge decision, not blocked on anything technical).
  - **Runnable: `npm test` green at 120/120** (8 new `planShareTopUp` cases,
    `inFlightByTarget`'s 5 existing cases updated for the new shape plus 2 new share cases, 8
    checker-fixture cases for the 3 new `verify-log` hard assertions run via synthetic fixtures
    against extracted pure functions in `test/verify-log-checks.js`, 13 cases for the new
    `test/windowed-rate.js` helper). `npm run verify:log` validated against real boundary-copied
    logs from the live session below (see Ring-buffer note) — all pass 13/13 once each copy is
    read as its own self-contained window.
  - **Two bugs found and fixed along the way, unrelated to the phase's own core logic**:
    `test/windowed-rate.js`'s income-window helper originally required a record be *fully
    contained* in a window to count it — found live that income records coalesce on their own
    rolling ~5min cadence independent of the A/B toggle boundaries, so straddling is the common
    case, not a rare edge; the strict filter silently dropped almost every record near every
    boundary. Rewritten to prorate by time-overlap instead. Separately,
    `verify-transactions.test.js`'s `VALID_EXPENSE_SOURCES` whitelist was missing
    `upgradecloudserver.js`'s `'single-server-upgrade'` source (a gap since that script's own
    phase, unrelated to Phase 8) — added.
  - **Ring-buffer eviction, observed exactly as the spec warned**: a log copy taken well after
    a toggle can contain leftover entries from the *previous* window whose own `mode` event has
    since aged out of the 2000-entry ring (only the single most recent `mode` event is pinned).
    `verify-log`'s `latestConfigAsOf`-style checks then have no config to validate those
    stragglers against — a real, false-positive-looking failure that isn't a code defect, just
    a consequence of validating a mixed-window copy as if it were one window. Confirmed by
    slicing the log from its own `mode` event onward (dropping the stragglers): all 13 checks
    pass clean. Lesson for the next A/B session: take boundary copies *more* frequently than
    just at the toggle moments, or always slice from the latest `mode` event before validating.
  - **Live A/B/A' session, NiteSec hacking-type faction work throughout (2026-07-04)**:
    - **A (share OFF), 3:12:20–3:17:23 PM, ~5min — short of the >=10min target**, flagged live
      and accepted as a known limitation (redoing the whole ~35min protocol wasn't worth it
      this session). Rep 15.612k→15.8k (thin data, not a reliable full-window rate).
    - **B (share ON), 3:17:23–3:28:28 PM, 11min 5sec** — meets the target. Rep 15.8k→17.65k
      (**2.78 rep/sec average**).
    - **A' (share OFF again), 3:28:28–3:39:33 PM, 11min 5sec** — meets the target. Rep
      17.65k→18.926k (**1.92 rep/sec average**).
    - **B-vs-A' is the trustworthy comparison** (both full >=10min windows, temporally
      adjacent, so much less exposed to session-long hacking-level drift than A is): **rep/sec
      was ~45% higher under share** (2.78 vs 1.92). This lines up well with the measured
      `sharePower` of 1.417 (a ~42% multiplier) — independent confirmation that share is doing
      what it's supposed to, for hacking-type faction work.
    - **Income (windowed, overlap-prorated)**: A ~$805M/min, B ~$494M/min, A' ~$2.25B/min.
      A-vs-B alone would suggest share cuts income roughly in half (plausible, matches the
      spec's accepted RAM/XP tradeoff), but A''s number is 4-5x everything else and is almost
      certainly dominated by natural hacking-level growth compounding over the ~30-minute
      session, not a share effect — **not clean enough to quote an income cost from this
      session** (see the Next Up follow-up item for a cleaner re-run).
    - **`sharecurve.js` run once during window B**: capacity 1.06 PB, 65,662 threads actually in
      flight (vs. the 25% target's theoretical 66,102 — the expected one-cycle-worker
      undershoot), measured `sharePower` 1.417. Curve: 5%→1.380, 10%→1.407, 15%→1.424,
      25%→1.444, 40%→1.463, 50%→1.472, 75%→1.488, 100%→1.499 (steep diminishing returns already
      visible — 25% already captures ~89% of the theoretical max power at 100% RAM commitment).
      Decision-rule check: predicted power at the actual 65,662 threads (interpolated) = 1.4437
      vs. measured 1.417 — a 1.85% gap, comfortably inside the 2x defect bound. **Pass, no
      defect.**
    - **Recommendation on `SHARE_FRACTION`: keep at 25% for now.** The curve's steep diminishing
      returns mean 25% already captures most of the achievable rep boost (raising it further
      buys little more power for a lot more batching RAM given the curve's shape), and this
      session's income-cost data isn't clean enough to justify either raising or lowering it
      with confidence. Revisit once the cleaner re-run (see Next Up) gives a trustworthy
      income-cost number.
  - **RAM gate: `share.js` closed at exactly 4.00 GB as expected (1.6 base + 2.4 `ns.share`).
    `daemon.js` measured 18.7 GB against an expected ~16.3 GB — unexplained +2.6 GB delta,
    waived as an acceptance criterion after an extensive live bisection failed to pin the exact
    cause** (see the two Next Up follow-up items for the full investigation trail and the
    accepted path forward).
  - A real, pre-existing Phase 7 bug in `pickBatchSet` was discovered during this session's log
    validation (natural-exit invariant failure) — not fixed here (out of this phase's stated
    scope, which explicitly excludes touching `pickBatchSet`'s internals); see the dedicated
    Next Up item for the full mechanism and a minimal repro.
- **Batcher refactor Phase 7 — multi-target batching with natural exit** (2026-07-04):
  `batcher-refactor-phase7.md`. Replaced the single hysteresis-protected incumbent with a
  RAM-bounded, score-greedy member set: `pickBatchSet` (scheduler.js, 4-pass admission/
  displacement/refill, replaces `pickBatchTarget`), `inFlightByTarget` (sampling.js, one
  combined `ns.ps` sweep replacing daemon.js's per-target `sumInFlightRam`/
  `countBatchesInFlight`), and a full daemon.js rewrite around a per-tick member loop
  (aggregate reserve carve, `enter`/`exit`/`snapshot` log events replacing `flip`, pinned
  `mode` event against ring-buffer eviction, per-target skip coalescing, redesigned tail
  display). `npm test` green at 88/88 (13 new `pickBatchSet` cases, 5 new `inFlightByTarget`
  cases, `pickBatchTarget`'s old suite removed).
  - **Live-verified same day (2026-07-04)**: ~34-minute formulas-mode session.
    `npm run verify:log` green (11/11, including all three new hard assertions —
    natural-exit invariant, budget invariant, enter/exit sanity). **Up to 10 targets batched
    concurrently** (member count: min 4 / avg 7.5 / max 10 across 110 retained snapshots) vs.
    exactly 1 before. **Utilization: min 6.9% / avg 20.3% / max 40.1%**, well above the
    pre-Phase-7 baseline of ~6.3%. **7 natural exits observed**, all organic (no forced
    `legacy-mode.txt` trick needed), reasons `unaffordable`/`displaced`; every exited server
    that had in-flight work drained and re-entered cleanly. Confirmed via
    `grep -rn "ns.kill\|killall" src/daemon.js`: zero call sites — natural exit is
    scheduling-only, exactly as designed.
  - **Real stress test, not synthetic**: mid-session, `upgradecloudserver.js` was run a
    couple of times, renaming/recreating a purchased host and silently killing whatever
    worker processes were running on it. This caused a mass simultaneous drift across
    nearly every active member and repeated rapid exit/re-entry cycling for the
    lowest-scored member (`n00dles`: 5 of the session's 7 exits, some only 8 seconds apart).
    Confirmed **not a Phase 7 defect** — an external fleet-operations confound any daemon
    design would be exposed to — but a good real-world robustness signal: all 11
    `verify-log` hard assertions still passed through it, including the natural-exit
    invariant holding across `n00dles`'s rapid cycling. Worth a future BACKLOG item on
    `upgradecloudserver.js` sharing `fleetupgrade.js`'s known rename-hazard, not filed yet.
  - **RAM gate: closed (2026-07-04).** `daemon.js` 16.10GB in-game — exact match to Phase 5's
    recorded 16.10GB baseline, zero growth (expected: no new `ns` API surface added).
  - **Income comparison: inconclusive, not concerning.** Session-window rate (~$587M/min)
    came in ~12.5% under Phase 5's baseline (~$671M/min), but the comparison is confounded
    by two factors unrelated to Phase 7's correctness: the highest-scored target (`phantasy`,
    score 2541 vs. next-highest 1850) sat mid-prep for the entire session without producing
    income, and the `upgradecloudserver.js` disruption above. Not treated as a regression;
    a clean uninterrupted re-run would be needed for a tight number, not done.
  - **Pushed to `origin/master` (2026-07-04).**
  - One open question from the spec stays open: evidence-window size vs. per-type log
    retention (all event types share one 2000-entry ring, so high-member-count sessions only
    retain the last several minutes for offline review) — deferred, not decided.
- **Batcher refactor Phase 5 — daily transactions log** (2026-07-04): `batcher-refactor-phase5.md`.
  Retired `moneymonitor.js` in favor of `src/translog.js` (shared write helper:
  `transactionsFileName`, `recordTransaction`, `shouldCoalesce`) and `src/transactionsmonitor.js`
  (income companion, replaces `moneymonitor.js`'s `launchDetached` slot, redraws its tail popup
  every poll rather than only on report events). Instrumented all four purchase call sites
  (`purchasescripts.js`, `upgradehomeram.js`, `purchasecloudservers.js`, `fleetupgrade.js`) to
  write an expense record on success. `npm test` green at 78/78 (65 existing + 13 new
  `test/translog.test.js` cases). Added `test/verify-transactions.test.js` alongside
  `test/verify-log.test.js`, both wired into `vitest.verify.config.ts`/`vitest.config.ts` via a
  `test/verify-*.test.js` glob — `npm run verify:log` now runs both, confirmed failing cleanly
  pre-session (no exported log yet) rather than silently passing.
  - **The phase's one behavior addition**: `fleetupgrade.js`'s two upgrade loops previously
    ignored `ns.cloud.upgradeServer`'s boolean return, so a failed upgrade silently reported
    (and would have logged) as a success. Added return-checks: failures now `tprint` a WARN
    per host and are excluded from both the terminal report and the transactions record; if
    zero hosts in a batch succeed, no record is written at all. Also reclassified the file's
    header (ONE-OFF → permanent manual utility), since it's now a permanent log call site.
  - **Live-verified same day (2026-07-04), post-merge**: daemon restarted with the merged
    code, `transactionsmonitor.js` confirmed running (tail popup showing correct running
    total/rate), `moneymonitor.js` deleted in-game. `transactions-2026-07-04.json`
    auto-exported to `logs/` after a viteburner dev-server hiccup was diagnosed and fixed
    (the process had been alive for 2+ hours but silently stopped producing fresh
    downloads — restarting it forced a clean reconnect and re-sync of everything,
    including the day file). `npm run verify:log` green (14/14) against the real file:
    two well-formed coalesced income records, $7.18B/10.7min in the soft report, zero
    hard-assertion failures.
  - **RAM gate: closed (2026-07-04).** `daemon.js` 16.1GB — exact match to Phase 4's recorded
    16.10GB baseline, zero growth (expected: `daemon.js` never imports `translog.js`, only
    swaps a filename string). `transactionsmonitor.js` 2.6GB — base(1.6) + `getMoneySources`
    (1.0) + `translog.js`'s 0GB `ns.read`/`ns.write`, actually *lighter* than the 3.10GB Phase
    4 recorded for old `moneymonitor.js` (this version never calls `ns.getPlayer()`, which the
    old total-balance line used and the new hacking-income-only design dropped).
    `upgradehomeram.js` 74.15GB matches its own header's "~74GB" almost exactly. No historical
    baseline on file for `purchasescripts.js` (50.15GB), `purchasecloudservers.js` (5.75GB),
    `fleetupgrade.js` (3.6GB) specifically, but the 0GB pattern held everywhere it was
    checkable, so no reason to expect growth there either.
  - **Purchase-during-income check: closed (2026-07-04), via an accidental live test.** A
    `purchasecloudservers.js` run with a mixed-up count argument bought 21 servers
    (`pserv-16gb-0`..`pserv-16gb-20`) in one burst; all 21 landed as correctly-shaped
    `cloud-purchase` expense records, sandwiched cleanly between two income records
    (10:31:15 AM and 10:32:57 AM) with no clobbering or dropped writes — exactly the
    multi-writer scenario the spec flagged as the real risk. All acceptance items for this
    phase are now closed. (The 21 servers were a mistake, not intentional — cleaned up with
    a throwaway `ns.cloud.deleteServer` script, unrelated to Phase 5 itself.)
  - **All acceptance items closed.** Since pushed to `origin/master` in an earlier session.
    Still remaining: delete the now-superseded `origin/worktree-batcher-phase5-translog`
    branch.
- **Batcher refactor Phase 4 — Formulas.exe math with legacy fallback** (2026-07-04): all
  runnable and observed acceptance criteria satisfied. Direct same-session comparison showed
  the churn fix (0 flips/16min formulas vs. 9/16min legacy) and reserve-ballooning fix
  (`depth` constant at 111-112 in formulas vs. swinging 31→209 in legacy) working exactly as
  designed. See `batcher-refactor-phase4.md`'s handoff section for full details.
  - **Waived, not done**: fleetupgrade-while-running live test (cash constraint) — revisit
    after next game reset. The guard's motivating failure (crash on a stale renamed host) was
    confirmed live against an unpatched daemon; the patched daemon's actual survival wasn't.
- Phase 1–3 of the batcher refactor (pipeline reservation waterfall, efficiency-score
  ranking, shrink gating) — see `batcher-refactor-phase1.md` through `phase3.md`.
