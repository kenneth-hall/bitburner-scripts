# Stock engine (prep — no engine built yet)

**Status (2026-07-23): research complete, TIX owned, no open measurement questions.** No
engine code exists yet. Tooling: `src/stockprobe.js` (read-only access/constants probe),
`src/buystockaccess.js` (logged tier-purchase helper), `src/stockrecon.js` (post-TIX
read-only harvest), `src/stockpostest.js` (install-boundary position experiment). **TIX API
access was purchased 2026-07-22 ($5b, logged as a `stock-access` expense) to run the recon** —
WSE, 4S UI, and 4S TIX remain unowned. This resolved four open questions in one pass (see
§6/§7). BN1's original TIX did **not** survive BitNode entry (all four flags read `false`
before this purchase; probe `logs/stockprobe-1784755786874.json`). This doc is the single
authoritative reference for stock-market mechanics, the full `ns.stock` API surface,
gates/costs, and the design considerations a future engine phase starts from — the same
role `gang-engine.md` and `batcher-engine.md` play for their engines.

Sources: this build's API docs (`markdown/bitburner.stock*.md` + related), the in-game
**Documentation → Basic Mechanics → Stock market** page (captured over CDP 2026-07-22,
v3.0.1), a live probe of `getConstants()`, and per-node multiplier tables copied from
[`bitnodes.md`](bitnodes.md). The retired pre-consolidation notes are archived at
[`archive/stock-market.md`](archive/stock-market.md).

## 1. Where this fits strategically

- **Not needed for BN2.1.** The gang funds the aug catalog faster than the shop can absorb
  it; adding a stock engine now advances nothing on the current goal.
- **It IS a buildable second engine today.** The standing "prototype a second engine"
  thread has listed only IPvGO and darknet as buildable-now (gang/corp/bladeburner/sleeves
  being node-locked) — **stock belongs on that list too.** It is available in every node,
  needs no Source-File, and its full scripted stack costs ~$30.2b — pocket change against
  the gang's income. It is also one of the "rep-tax killer"-adjacent income engines that
  work when hacking income is nerfed (BN8 zeroes almost everything else).
- **BN8 ("Ghost of Wall Street") is the node that *forces* this engine.** All non-stock
  income is zeroed there (confirmed numerically in `bitnodes.md`): script hack money 0%,
  crime/darknet/infiltration/company/hacknet/contract money 0%, gang softcap 0, corp and
  bladeburner disabled. You start with $250m + WSE/TIX granted, and shorts + limit/stop
  orders work in-node. A pre-4S-capable script is the standard preparation (4S costs
  scale per-node; see §3 cost table). Hack/grow against a stock's server still moves its
  price there — the batcher survives as a *market-manipulation* tool, not an income tool.
- **SF8 levels change what's usable outside BN8:** L1 permanent WSE+TIX everywhere,
  L2 shorts everywhere, L3 limit/stop orders everywhere (+hack-growth mults 12/18/21%).
  We own **SF8 level 0**, so today, outside BN8: no shorts, no limit/stop orders, ever —
  **a current-save engine is long-only, market-order-only.** This resolves the API docs'
  vague "unlocked later in the game" phrasing: the unlock is BN8 (in-node) or SF8.2/8.3
  (everywhere).

## 2. Access model — two independent doors, plus a premium add-on per door

The doors gate **method** (UI vs script), not action (read vs trade). Each door covers
both reading and trading for its own method; you can hold either without the other.

| Purchase | Gates | Prereq | Cost (base; BN2 = baseline) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **WSE account** (`purchaseWseAccount`) | Manual trading via the Stock Market UI (City tab, any city) | none | $200m |
| **TIX API access** (`purchaseTixApi`) | Scripted trading via `ns.stock.*` | none (explicitly does not need WSE) | $5b |
| **4S Market Data** (`purchase4SMarketData`) | Forecast/volatility columns in the UI only | WSE account | $1b |
| **4S Market Data TIX API** (`purchase4SMarketDataTixApi`) | `getForecast()` / `getVolatility()` via script | TIX API access | $25b |

Costs measured live via `getConstants()` 2026-07-22 (BN2 has no Stock Market multiplier
row → base values). Commission is **$100k flat per transaction** (same constant). The two
4S purchases are fully independent of each other — buying the UI one does nothing for
scripts and vice versa.

**Per-node cost scaling:** several nodes multiply 4S costs ("Market Data Cost" scales
`MarketData4SCost`, "Market Data API Cost" scales `MarketDataTixApi4SCost`) — BN7
200%/200%, BN9 500%/400%, BN10 400%/400%, BN12ish 102%/102%, one node 1000%/1000% —
per-node rows live in [`bitnodes.md`](bitnodes.md), which stays the reference for those
tables.

### Reset behavior

- **BitNode entry wipes all four flags — confirmed.** TIX API was owned in BN1
  (2026-07-04); the 2026-07-22 BN2.1 probe reads all four `false`. Only SF8.1 makes
  WSE+TIX permanent across nodes.
- **Augmentation installs: access flags SURVIVE — verified 2026-07-23.** `stockprobe.js`
  run either side of a real install (`stockprobe-1784814815072.json` →
  `stockprobe-1784815070260.json`) reads `tixApi: true` both times. Unlike TOR/programs,
  the $30b access stack is bought **once per BitNode**, not once per install cycle. This
  makes the access spend a fixed per-node cost, not a recurring one.
- **Open positions DO NOT survive an install — verified 2026-07-23, and liquidating first
  does not help.** A 2,491-share ECP long ($99.987m mark-to-market) taken immediately
  before an install read back `sharesLong: 0` immediately after (`stockpostest.js
  buy`/`check`). The stronger conclusion, which supersedes this section's earlier
  "liquidate-before-install hook" proposal: **no stock value crosses an install by any
  route.** Money hard-resets to ~$1k, so selling into cash before the install loses
  exactly as much as holding through it. There is nothing to hook.
  - **Design consequence.** A stock engine's capital is destroyed at every install
    boundary. Its usable working period is *one install cycle*, and profit is only
    realized if it is **spent before the install fires** (augs, RAM, servers) rather than
    held as float or shares. In a node running the aug-ratchet's autonomous installs on a
    multi-hour cadence, that window is short and the engine must be built to bank into
    purchases, not to compound. This is the single biggest lifecycle design constraint
    carried out of this research pass — it argues a stock engine belongs in a
    **long-cycle or install-free** context (BN8, or a node being held open), not bolted
    onto the ratchet.

## 3. Market mechanics (in-game Documentation page, v3.0.1)

### Ticks and offline behavior
- Prices update every **~6s** (`msPerStockUpdate` 6000). The market does **not** process
  while the game is closed; it accumulates bonus time instead, and runs **50% faster**
  (4s ticks, `msPerStockUpdateMin` 4000) until bonus time drains. `getBonusTime()`
  reports the accumulated ms. `nextUpdate()` resolves after each tick (always reports
  6000 ms of market time processed).
- `TicksPerCycle` = **75** — internal constant governing when a stock's forecast flips.
  With 6s ticks that's a ~7.5-minute cycle granularity; treat forecast regimes as
  stable-for-minutes, not per-tick noise.

### Prices, spread, and what you actually pay
- Each stock has a **bid** (highest buyer) and **ask** (lowest seller); ask > bid always;
  "price" = their average. **Long buys execute at ask, long sells at bid; shorts are
  reversed** (short entry at bid, short exit at ask). The spread is a built-in round-trip
  cost on top of the $100k commission.
- `getPurchaseCost`/`getSaleGain` fold in spread, commission, **and** the price impact of
  large transactions — use them rather than shares×price arithmetic.
- Each stock has a **max shares** cap (`getMaxShares`, long+short combined) and a soft
  price cap ("maximum price" — a hidden per-stock property, not a hard limit).

### Forecast and second-order forecast
- **Forecast** = P(price increases next tick), 0–1. Visible only with 4S (UI column with
  4S UI; `getForecast()` with 4S TIX).
- **Second-order forecast** = the value the forecast itself trends toward over time
  (RNG-driven, may never arrive). **Always hidden** — no purchase reveals it; it can only
  be inferred from forecast drift.
- Hidden per-stock properties beyond these: volatility (max %-move per tick — 4S reveals
  it), transaction-influence susceptibility, spread %, soft price cap.

### Things that move the market
- **Your own transactions**: buying/selling in size moves the forecast (and, much more
  weakly, the second-order forecast) in the direction of your trade. Magnitude scales
  with share count. This is both a cost (your entry moves price against you — visible in
  `getPurchaseCost`) and a lever.
- **Hacking a server with a corresponding stock** (e.g. `foodnstuff` ↔ FoodNStuff) with
  `{ stock: true }` in `BasicHGWOptions`: chance (∝ fraction of server money stolen) to
  push the **second-order forecast down**. Continuous hacking = sustained downward trend.
- **Growing** with `{ stock: true }`: same mechanism, second-order forecast **up**.
- **Working for a company** with a corresponding stock: second-order forecast up, potency
  ∝ work effectiveness.
- **`ns.dnet.promoteStock(sym)`** (this fork's darknet API, 2 GB): raises a stock's
  **volatility** (not forecast — bigger per-tick swings, direction unchanged), scales
  with charisma + threads, decays if not reapplied, needs no server access. Only useful
  paired with an actual trading edge (see [`darknet.md`](darknet.md)).
- Full server↔stock / company↔stock mapping is enumerable post-TIX via `getSymbols()` +
  `getOrganization()` — not yet captured (needs the $5b purchase). Symbol count in this
  fork also unverified until then.

### Positions
- **Long**: buy low sell high; limited downside, unlimited upside.
- **Short**: profit on decline; margin = sale proceeds + current stock value; **limited
  upside, unlimited downside — a deep-underwater short can drive money negative.**
  Locked outside BN8 without SF8.2 (see §1).
- The in-game doc's own headline warning: flat commission ⇒ **high-frequency trading is
  not a good strategy.**

### Order types (locked outside BN8 without SF8.3)
Market orders execute immediately. Limit/stop orders (via `placeOrder`) execute
conditionally:

| Order | Long | Short |
|---|---|---|
| Limit **buy** | price ≤ order | price ≥ order |
| Limit **sell** | price ≥ order | price ≤ order |
| Stop **buy** | price ≥ order | price ≤ order |
| Stop **sell** | price ≤ order | price ≥ order |

## 4. API reference — `ns.stock.*`

RAM costs from this build's `markdown/` docs. **Gate** = what must be owned before the
call works at runtime (RAM cost is static regardless).

| Method | RAM | Gate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hasWseAccount()` / `hasTixApiAccess()` / `has4SData()` / `has4SDataTixApi()` | 0.05 ea | none | The four access flags. Verified callable with nothing owned. |
| `getConstants()` | 0 | none (verified live) | Returns `StockMarketConstants` (see below). |
| `getBonusTime()` | 0 | **TIX (verified live — throws without it)** | 0 GB ≠ no precondition, same trap class as the gang API. |
| `nextUpdate()` | 0 | **TIX (verified — works TIX-only, no 4S; returns 6000)** | `await` = sleep until next tick; the engine's main-loop primitive. |
| `getSymbols()` | 2 | TIX | All tradable symbols (**33 in this fork — verified**). |
| `getPrice(sym)` | 2 | doc says WSE + TIX; **likely TIX-only (see OQ3)** | avg of bid/ask. Not directly tested, but its twin `getOrganization` works TIX-only. |
| `getAskPrice(sym)` / `getBidPrice(sym)` | 2 ea | TIX (no WSE mentioned) | The real transaction prices. **Verified TIX-only.** |
| `getOrganization(sym)` | 2 | **TIX-only (verified — WSE not required despite the docs)** | Company name behind a symbol — builds the server↔stock map. |
| `getMaxShares(sym)` | 2 | TIX | Long+short combined cap. |
| `getPosition(sym)` | 2 | TIX | `[sharesLong, avgLongPrice, sharesShort, avgShortPrice]`. |
| `getPurchaseCost(sym, n, pos)` / `getSaleGain(sym, n, pos)` | 2 ea | TIX | Include spread + commission + own price impact. |
| `buyStock(sym, n)` / `sellStock(sym, n)` | 2.5 ea | TIX | Market orders. Return execution price per share, 0 on failure. Sell of more than owned sells all. Sell profit is credited to the script's stats. |
| `buyShort(sym, n)` / `sellShort(sym, n)` | 2.5 ea | TIX + BN8-or-SF8.2 | Same return convention. |
| `placeOrder(sym, n, price, type, pos)` | 2.5 | TIX + BN8-or-SF8.3 | Limit/stop only. Boolean. |
| `cancelOrder(...)` (same args) | 2.5 | TIX + BN8-or-SF8.3 | void. |
| `getOrders()` | 2.5 | TIX + BN8-or-SF8.3 | `Record<sym, StockOrder[]>`; only symbols with live orders appear. |
| `purchaseWseAccount()` / `purchaseTixApi()` | 2.5 ea | money | True if bought or already owned. |
| `purchase4SMarketData()` | 2.5 | WSE + money | UI columns only. |
| `purchase4SMarketDataTixApi()` | 2.5 | TIX + money | Unlocks the two calls below. |
| `getForecast(sym)` | 2.5 | 4S TIX | P(rise next tick), 0–1. **The** trading signal. **Verified: throws `"You don't have 4S Market Data TIX API Access!"` on TIX-only** — the signal is genuinely gated behind the $25b buy. |
| `getVolatility(sym)` | 2.5 | 4S TIX | Max %-move per tick, 0–1. Same 4S gate. |

### Data structures & enums

- **`StockMarketConstants`** (from `getConstants()`, measured 2026-07-22):
  `msPerStockUpdate` 6000 · `msPerStockUpdateMin` 4000 · `TicksPerCycle` 75 ·
  `WseAccountCost` 200e6 · `TixApiCost` 5e9 · `MarketData4SCost` 1e9 ·
  `MarketDataTixApi4SCost` 25e9 · `StockMarketCommission` 100e3.
- **`StockOrder`**: `{ shares, price, type: OrderType, position: PositionType }`.
- **`PositionType`** (`ns.enums.PositionType`): `Long: "L"`, `Short: "S"`.
- **`OrderType`** (`ns.enums.OrderType`): `LimitBuy/LimitSell/StopBuy/StopSell` →
  `"Limit Buy Order"` etc.
- **Related surfaces elsewhere in `ns`:**
  - `BasicHGWOptions.stock?: boolean` — the hack/grow market-influence flag (§3).
  - `MoneySource.stock: number` — cumulative stock P/L in the money-sources breakdown
    (how an engine's lifetime profit gets audited).
  - `ns.dnet.promoteStock(sym)` — volatility pump (§3).

### Fork/gotcha notes

- **0 GB does not mean callable** — `getBonusTime()` throws without TIX (verified). Probe
  with `has*` flags first; assume `nextUpdate()` is gated the same way.
- **RAM identifier hygiene**: the analyzer bills property/variable *names* that match
  `ns` methods. `stock` itself is a 0 GB namespace so `{ stock: true }` literals are
  safe, but locals named e.g. `getPrice`/`buyStock`-style, or short names shadowing other
  `ns` methods, still trip it (see CLAUDE.md's rule; `ls`/`ps` class).
- The API-doc examples reference symbols like `FSIG`/`ECP`/`NVMD`/`SYSC` — fork's real
  list unverified until `getSymbols()` runs.

## 5. Engine design considerations (for the future brainstorm — not decisions)

- **Cost of entry for a scripted engine: $30b** (TIX $5b + 4S TIX $25b). At current gang
  income (~$10m/s ⇒ ~$36b/hr) that's under an hour of income; trivially affordable
  whenever a stock phase starts. WSE + 4S UI (+$1.2b) are optional but cheap
  observability for Kenneth's own screen.
- **Pre-4S operation is possible without buying anything extra**: forecast is P(up), so
  an observer can estimate it per-stock from tick up/down frequency over a window
  (`nextUpdate()` loop + price history). This is the standard prep for BN8, where 4S
  costs may be scaled. Expect estimates to lag real forecast flips by ~tens of ticks —
  the `TicksPerCycle`=75 regime length is what makes estimation workable at all.
- **Economics of a trade**: edge must clear flat $100k commission ×2 + spread + own price
  impact. Pushes toward few, large, long-held positions in high-|forecast| stocks —
  matching the in-game doc's anti-HFT warning.
- **Long-only reality (this save, non-BN8)**: only forecast > 0.5 stocks are tradeable;
  bear regimes are sit-out time. Roughly halves the exploitable signal vs BN8/SF8.2.
- **Batcher synergy**: workers already hammer servers with hack/grow; flipping
  `{ stock: true }` on targets that have stocks turns the batcher into a forecast bias
  the trader can front-run (grow-heavy prep pushes second-order forecast up while
  holding long). Zero extra RAM. Needs the server↔stock map (§3) and coordination so
  hack-phases don't fight held positions.
- **Capital custody vs the finance manager**: a stock engine parks money *outside* the
  cash balance that `resourcemanager`/`augfarmer` budget against — and that money is
  destroyed at the next install (§2, verified). Two consequences: reserved-money
  accounting needs explicit design, and the engine is in **direct competition with the
  aug ratchet for the same dollars**, with the ratchet holding the better claim (its
  purchases persist; stock positions don't). Any stock phase has to answer why capital
  sitting in shares beats the same capital sitting in an aug.
- **Loop shape**: `await ns.stock.nextUpdate()` (0 GB) beats `sleep(6000)` polling — tick
  alignment for free, and it stretches correctly under bonus-time 4s ticks.

## 6. Measured state (2026-07-22, BN2.1)

### Pre-purchase probe
`logs/stockprobe-1784755786874.json` (`run stockprobe.js`, repeatable any time):
all four access flags `false`; constants as in §4.

### TIX-owned recon (`logs/stockrecon-1784757368546.json`)
TIX API was purchased ($5b, logged) and `stockrecon.js` harvested everything TIX unlocks
read-only. **Findings:**

- **Symbol count: 33** — the fork's list is vanilla-identical (the API-doc examples
  `FSIG`/`ECP`/`NVMD`/`SYSC` are all real). Full symbol↔organization map below.
- **`getOrganization` works on TIX alone** (`wse: false` throughout) — the docs' "requires
  WSE Account" claim is **not enforced** in this fork. The server↔stock map needs no $200m
  WSE purchase. (`getPrice` shares that doc claim and was not directly tested, but its twin
  passing is strong evidence it's also TIX-only; the engine uses ask/bid regardless.)
- **`nextUpdate()` works on TIX alone**, returns 6000 — the loop primitive is TIX-gated,
  not 4S-gated.
- **`getForecast()` throws on TIX-only** (`"You don't have 4S Market Data TIX API Access!"`)
  — the trading signal is genuinely locked behind the $25b 4S TIX buy. TIX gives prices, not
  P(up).
- **Spread is the friction floor.** At a sample position of 5% of each stock's max shares
  (long, market), the measured round-trip loss (`getPurchaseCost − getSaleGain`) equals the
  bid/ask spread almost exactly — i.e. the flat $200k round-trip commission and own-price
  impact are both **negligible at sane position sizes** (a 5%-of-max ECP position is already
  ~$24b; $200k on that is 0.0008%). Price impact only bites at much larger fractions of
  float. This refines §5's economics: **the edge a trade must clear is essentially its
  stock's spread**, not commission.

**Spread ranking (= round-trip friction floor), 33 stocks:**

| Spread | Symbols |
|---|---|
| **~0.40%** (cheapest) | ECP, BLD, CLRK |
| ~0.60% | KGI, HLS |
| ~0.80% | OMTK |
| ~1.00% | MGCP, FLCM, STM, RHOC |
| ~1.19% | NVMD, NTLK, MDYN |
| ~1.39% | FSIG |
| ~1.59% | LXO, SYSC |
| ~1.78% | VITA, ICRS, UNV, GPH, FNS, SGC, TITN |
| ~1.98% | DCOMM, AERO |
| ~2.18% | OMN, SLRS, WDS, OMGA |
| ~2.37% | CTK, CTYS |
| ~2.76% | JGN |
| **~3.15%** (priciest) | APHE |

**Symbol ↔ organization map (33, for the server/company↔stock wiring):**

| Sym | Organization | Sym | Organization | Sym | Organization |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ECP | ECorp | HLS | Helios Labs | NTLK | NetLink Technologies |
| MGCP | MegaCorp | VITA | VitaLife | OMGA | Omega Software |
| BLD | Blade Industries | ICRS | Icarus Microsystems | FNS | FoodNStuff |
| CLRK | Clarke Incorporated | UNV | Universal Energy | JGN | Joe's Guns |
| OMTK | OmniTek Incorporated | AERO | AeroCorp | SGC | Sigma Cosmetics |
| FSIG | Four Sigma | OMN | Omnia Cybersystems | CTYS | Catalyst Ventures |
| KGI | KuaiGong International | SLRS | Solaris Space Systems | MDYN | Microdyne Technologies |
| FLCM | Fulcrum Technologies | GPH | Global Pharmaceuticals | TITN | Titan Laboratories |
| STM | Storm Technologies | NVMD | Nova Medical | | |
| DCOMM | DefComm | WDS | Watchdog Security | | |
| | | LXO | LexoCorp | | |
| | | RHOC | Rho Construction | | |
| | | APHE | Alpha Enterprises | | |
| | | SYSC | SysCore Securities | | |
| | | CTK | CompuTek | | |

(The server↔stock mapping — which of these orgs own hackable servers, for the `{stock:true}`
batcher synergy — still needs cross-referencing org names against the server list; that's a
pure local computation now that the map exists.)

## 7. Open questions

### Resolved 2026-07-22 (TIX-owned recon)
- ~~**OQ3 — `getPrice`/`getOrganization` WSE claim.**~~ **RESOLVED:** `getOrganization`
  works on TIX alone; the docs' WSE requirement is not enforced in this fork. Engine uses
  ask/bid regardless, so `getPrice` never needs calling.
- ~~**OQ4 — symbol list / map.**~~ **RESOLVED:** 33 symbols, full symbol↔org map captured
  (§6). The remaining server↔stock cross-reference is a local computation, not a probe.
- ~~**`nextUpdate` / `getForecast` gates.**~~ **RESOLVED:** `nextUpdate` works TIX-only;
  `getForecast`/`getVolatility` are hard-gated behind the $25b 4S TIX buy (§4/§6).

### Resolved 2026-07-23 (install-boundary experiment)

Both remaining questions were answered in one pass, riding a forced install that the aug
ratchet needed anyway. Tooling: `src/stockpostest.js` (`buy` before, `check` after).

- ~~**OQ1 — do access flags survive an aug install?**~~ **RESOLVED: yes.** `tixApi` reads
  `true` on both sides of the boundary (§2). Access is a per-BitNode purchase.
- ~~**OQ2 — do open positions convert to cash on install, or vaporize?**~~ **RESOLVED:
  neither survives, and the distinction doesn't matter.** Shares read `0` after the
  install, and because money also hard-resets to ~$1k, pre-liquidating to cash loses the
  same amount. **No stock value crosses an install.** See §2 for the design consequence —
  this retires the proposed "liquidate-before-install" hook as a non-fix and reframes
  where a stock engine can profitably live.

### Still open

Nothing blocking. The next question is a design one, not a measurement one: **given that
capital cannot cross an install, what install cadence makes a stock engine worth
building?** That belongs to a stock phase's brainstorm, not to this reference.
