# Phase 25 — close-out handoff (2026-07-16, L7 closed 2026-07-17, gap 7 found 2026-07-18)

**Read this first if you're picking up Phase 25 cold.** The spec
(`phase-25-faction-strategy.spec.md`) is the design record and its "Close-out (2026-07-15)"
section is the BN1.2-clear record. This doc is the *handoff*.

**Status:** shipped 2026-07-14 · cleared BN1.2 2026-07-15 · S11's gate met 2026-07-16 ·
L7 passed 2026-07-17 — every step of the cycle has executed at least once. Reading L7's logs
turned up two bugs (gaps 5 and 6); both fixed the same day, and the NFG price ladder they
exposed is now measured (2.166) and the projection corrected.

**Then the cycle stalled.** After install #8 (2026-07-17 9:45), the auto ratchet sat **25
hours in `phase: "grinding"` doing nothing** — `gainArmed: true`, gain 2.36, $3.3q idle,
`phaseArmed: false` permanently. That is **gap 7**, found and fixed 2026-07-18. Three gaps are
open — 3, 4 and 7's follow-on — and the earlier "the phase has no open tests" line was
retracted with it.

**Read this before trusting the "proven" column below: proven ≠ repeatable.** Every step had
executed at least once, and the cycle still could not run itself a third time unattended. The
table records coverage, not reliability.

## L7 — the first auto fire (2026-07-17, install #6)

Ran end-to-end, unmodified, on the first attempt. **`auto` is still set** — the next fire
comes when the cycle rebuilds (~4-8h).

Sequence, all inside 11 seconds:

```
6:09:00  trigger-fire      sustained 600.9s/600s, gain 1.173, 7 queued, 15 NFG projected
6:09:00  spend-down-start  buys Synaptic Enhancement Implant + 11 NFG levels
6:09:10  installer-exec    pid 1766424
6:09:10  install           ramTiers 0 (already maxed), coreTiers 3 -> 4 cores, $485.6b
6:09:11  install fires     mult.hacking 1.632 -> 1.839, level 857 -> 1, 7 augs activated
6:09:11  bootstrap.js relaunched via cbScript -- studybootstrap/procureprograms/cloudmanager up
```

What install #6 bought:

| | pre (6:08:43) | post (6:09:11) | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mults.hacking` | 1.632 | **1.839** | +12.7% |
| `mults.hacking_exp` | 1.704 | **2.823** | +65.7% |
| `mults.faction_rep` | 1.491 | **2.125** | +42.5% |
| augs installed | 8 | **15** | Daedalus gate 15/30 |
| home cores | 1 | **4** | step 12's first-ever run |

**Recovery was clean and fast.** Within 5 minutes: 7 factions rejoined, hacking 1 → 494,
`phase: grinding`. The **post-install false arm did not recur** (`gainArmed: false`, 0
queued) — the main auto-mode risk carried out of the BN1.2 clear, now settled on real data.

**Two predictions confirmed:** the observe-mode flap is real and ran at a **10:21 cadence**
(`would install now` at 5:27:36 / 5:37:57 / 5:48:18 / 5:58:39) right up until the flip; and
the latch works as specced — `evalTrigger` checks `priorState.fired && mode === "auto"`
*before* recomputing, so flipping to `auto` with sustain already complete fired immediately
and the flap could not abort it.

---

## Where the automation actually stands

The cycle repeats ~15-25× per BN1 clear. **Every step is now proven.**

| # | Step | Owner | Status |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Reset → cold start | `installAugmentations("bootstrap.js")` | **proven 2026-07-17** |
| 2 | Fleet + batcher up | `bootstrap.js` → `daemon.js` | proven |
| 3 | CS-class kick (hacking 1 → climb) | `studybootstrap.js` | proven |
| 4 | Buy fleet | `cloudmanager.js` | proven |
| 5 | TOR + 5 port openers | `procureprograms.js` | proven |
| 6 | Backdoor faction servers | `backdoorfactions.js` | proven |
| 7 | Join, grind rep, buy augs + 1 NFG | `augfarmer.js` | proven |
| 8 | Trigger arms → fires | `evalTrigger` | proven 2026-07-16 |
| 9 | Spend-down (NFG cap lifts, fleet freezes) | `augfarmer.js` auto branch | **proven 2026-07-17** |
| 10 | `ns.exec("installer.js")` | `augfarmer.js` | **proven 2026-07-17** |
| 11 | Max home RAM | `installer.js:64` | proven by hand 2026-07-16 (no-op at 64 TB) |
| 12 | Max home cores | `installer.js:83` | **proven 2026-07-17** (1 → 4) |
| 13 | Install → back to 1 | `installer.js:113` | **proven 2026-07-17** |

Endgame (once per clear) — Daedalus reserve → join → donate → The Red Pill → `backdoorwd.js`
— all fired live 2026-07-15, **one rep each**.

**Blast radius was as estimated.** `installer.js` refuses to act unless `ratchet-mode.txt`
reads exactly `auto`; the cbScript fired; nothing needed a hand-recovery.

---

## S11: the gate is met (and why it couldn't have been before)

The spec closed with S11 unmet: the trigger armed once but never sustained, and **no
`install-ready` fire was ever observed**. That was not bad luck — **the trigger was dead
code**, and every arm on record predates the fix that killed it.

- **Bug 1 (`aeeb632`).** `evalTrigger`'s grind horizon read `pickTarget`'s **head** target.
  Phase 25's own same-day `buyBlocked` fix (`9a6643c`) made NFG a permanent candidate — and
  the head is always NFG, rep-met at deficit 0 — so the horizon was always `0/rate = 0` and
  `phaseArmed` could never be true. `idle-plateau` was unreachable for the same reason (NFG
  is always a candidate; when none is reachable, `queuedCount` is 0 and `gainArmed` fails).
  **No arm was possible in any cycle** — `ratchet-mode.txt` → `auto` would have been a no-op.
- **Bug 2 (`3feb4b4`).** Routing the horizon through `pickWorkFaction` fixed only the
  actively-worked case: it skips PASSIVE_REP_FACTIONS and falls back to the rep-met head, so
  a passive-only plateau still couldn't arm. Observed live with every remaining grind on
  NiteSec/The Black Hand/BitRunners while $1.47T sat idle. `pickHorizonGrind` now takes the
  sorted candidates and returns the highest-priority one still owed rep — `pickWorkFaction`'s
  filter **minus the passive skip, no head fallback**.
- **Bug 3 (`b5b654d`).** `dashboard.js` showed `target` (the head) and omitted the work
  faction, so it read "grinding for NFG at CyberSec" while the slot ground Sector-12. Kenneth
  spotted it; that panel is how the dead trigger stayed invisible for a day.

All three are one confusion: **"what do we buy next" ≠ "what are we waiting on" ≠ "what
should the slot work."** Expect this to keep biting; it has now bitten **four** times — gap
(6) below is the same shape again (*"who sells it" ≠ "who we have rep with"*), found
2026-07-17. Whenever this code names a faction, ask which of these four questions it is
actually answering.

**The datum, finally collected:**

```
trigger-arm    2026-07-16T22:32:14Z   horizon 55.47h (threshold 8h), gain 1.370,
                                      8 augs queued, ~$1.47T idle, nothing buyable
trigger-fire   2026-07-16T22:42:14Z   clean 600s sustain → phase: install-ready
```

Kenneth's verdict on the timing: **"about right."** That is S11's validation datum.

Also settled: the **post-install false arm does not recur.** Install #5's post state shows
`armed: false`, `gainArmed: false`, gain 1.000 — `queuedCount` 0 blocks it as designed. That
was the main auto-mode risk carried out of the BN1.2 clear.

---

## Gaps — final state at freeze

**Gap numbers are stable IDs** (`BACKLOG.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and CLAUDE.md all cite them), so
they keep their original numbers and the list reads out of order. Every gap below is either
**CLOSED** (a Phase 25 defect, fixed) or **→ PHASE 26** (a design question, moved out — see the
freeze banner). Nothing is left open *here*.

9. **The engine cannot reach the Daedalus gate on its own — a hard deadlock. → PHASE 26.**
   Found 2026-07-18 while checking a `company_rep` request; **this is what is blocking the BN1.3
   clear right now.** State: 29/30 distinct augs, `endgameHold` on, `$288t` idle, hacking 4251.
   - **The loop.** `endgameHold` blocks arming (`gainArmed` requires `!endgameHold`), so no
     spend-down ever runs. Outside spend-down `planActions` only ever buys the **head** target.
     The head is NFG (score 0.022), which outranks the only reachable real aug — Embedded
     Netburner Module Analyze Engine (0.015) — **forever**. So: grind to NFG's 998,737 → buy a
     level → **the distinct count does not move** (NFG is one entry, per gap 3) → repReq jumps
     ×1.14 to 1.138m → repeat. It never buys the aug that closes the gate.
   - **Cheapest exit is absurdly cheap and the engine can't see it.** Wired Reflexes: **1,250
     rep, $0.004b**, against $288t on hand. It's filtered out for scoring 0 on hacking — correct
     by stat value, wrong by *what we need*, which is +1 to a count.
   - **Sixth instance of this doc's recurring confusion** ("what to buy" ≠ "what we're waiting
     on" ≠ "what to work" ≠ **"what unlocks a gate"**). Six is a pattern, not luck: `score` is
     doing four jobs and the engine has **no representation of what it is currently trying to
     achieve.** That root cause, not another patch, is Phase 26's thesis.
   - **Do NOT fix by weighting `company_rep`** — the request that surfaced this. It would admit
     4 zero-hacking augs, *miss* the actually-cheapest exit (Wired Reflexes is a combat aug), and
     permanently value a stat we never earn. Kenneth called this out as a naive hardcode before
     any code was written; he was right.
8. **~~NFG's rep requirement was recorded as not climbing with level. It climbs ×1.14.~~ Fixed
   2026-07-18 — but the *strategic* consequence is open and is the ratchet's next real problem.**
   Full mechanics now in **`docs/neuroflux.md`**; this is the phase-local record.
   - **The false fact.** Gap 6's write-up asserted, as checked, that NFG's rep requirement doesn't
     climb. Install #9 disproves it: repReq **122,736 → 998,737 over exactly 16 levels** = 8.137 =
     **1.14¹⁶**. The original check compared a before/after that spanned a catalog which hadn't
     rebuilt. *A before/after across an install is only as good as the rebuild between them* —
     check the catalog's timestamp moved, not just its values.
   - **Why it's load-bearing.** Rep resets to zero on every install; the requirement doesn't.
     Each cycle re-earns, from scratch, a requirement that only grows: **10k → 123k → 999k** over
     three installs. Money bound the tail for installs #6-#9, so this stayed invisible — but rep
     income is roughly linear per cycle while the requirement compounds, so **rep takes over as
     the binding constraint and then shrinks the tail every cycle.** The tail is most of the gain
     (16 NFG levels vs 6 discrete augs at #9), so **per-cycle gain will decay toward the discrete
     augs alone.**
   - **Follow-up the same hour (`491f6a0`), worth its own line.** The first fix guarded on
     `nfgRep > 0 && nfgRepReq > 0` as "was rep info supplied?" — which **cannot distinguish "no
     info" from "zero usable rep."** The second is the case the fix exists for, so it fell back
     to the money-only projection precisely where it mattered. Caught on live state minutes after
     shipping: repReq 998,737 vs ~180k rep, tail fully suppressed, projection still claiming 14
     levels and `totalGain` 1.1495 — already past `MIN_TOTAL_GAIN`, with only `queuedCount: 0`
     holding the trigger down. `repReq > 0` alone now marks supplied-ness. **Lesson: a `0`
     default that doubles as a "missing" sentinel is the same bug wearing different clothes** —
     and I shipped it *while fixing that exact class*.
   - **Fixed in code:** `NFG_REP_LADDER` + `nfgLevelsByRep`; `spendDownPlan`'s tail and
     `evalTrigger`'s projection are now bounded by **both** ladders. Previously the projection was
     money-only — documented as "accepted optimism ... NFG's rep requirement may bind first",
     which was fine while it never did. It inflates `totalGain`, which is what `MIN_TOTAL_GAIN`
     gates on, so this would have started firing installs on gains that couldn't be realized.
   - **Open — the strategy, not the arithmetic.** Nothing plans NFG rep as an *expense*. The two
     counters are donation (money → rep, the only lever that scales with our surplus) and rising
     `faction_rep` mults. Both exist in the engine; neither is aimed at NFG. Decide before the
     decay shows up as a mysteriously falling `totalGain`.
7. **~~The trigger cannot arm at a rep-complete plateau.~~ FIXED 2026-07-18 — but read the
   lesson, it is the important part.** After install #8 the cycle sat **25 hours** in
   `phase: "grinding"` with nothing to do:
   ```
   trigger: { armed: false, horizonMs: null,
              reasons: { gainArmed: true, phaseArmed: false } }
   totalGain 2.356 · nfgLevelsProjected 16 · money $3,336t · 6 augs queued
   ```
   **Mechanism.** Of the 38 augs reachable from our 8 joined factions, **zero still owed rep**,
   so `pickHorizonGrind` correctly returned `{faction: undefined}` — and `evalTrigger` read
   that as "no horizon measured, don't arm" when it actually means "**nothing left to wait
   on**", which is arming evidence. The `idle-plateau` path that should have caught it is
   unreachable: NFG's per-cycle cap (`buyBlocked`) keeps the head target non-rep-met, so
   `planActions` takes the grind branch (`augfarmer.js:1004`) and the action list is never
   empty. A real plateau wearing the `grinding` label.
   - **Fixed** in `evalTrigger`: `grinding` + no faction owed rep ⇒ `phaseArmed = true`.
     Money-blocked is deliberately excluded — that state is `awaiting-money`, which still never
     arms, so the plateau read only fires when *rep* has run out of things to buy.
   - **Fifth instance of this doc's recurring confusion.** Bugs 1 and 2 were the same state —
     everything rep-met, horizon undefined — and **both fixes only widened *which* faction gets
     picked. Neither handled "correctly picks none."** Three fixes in, the null case had still
     never been tested. When this code names a faction, also ask what it means when it names
     *nothing*.
   - **It failed exactly the way gap 4 predicts a companion death would:** silent permanent
     stop, indistinguishable from healthy at a glance, invisible until someone read the logs.
     Different cause, identical signature. **So gap 4's supervisor must watch progress
     liveness, not process liveness** — every process here was alive and healthy for 25 hours.
     That is a design constraint on gap 4, discovered by gap 7.
   - **Follow-on, still open:** nothing detects "auto mode, hours elapsed, no install." A
     stall-age check is the cheap general net that would have caught this class on day one.
4. **No supervision — the Level-2 gap. THE ONE THAT MATTERS.** Companions launch at
   `daemon.js:415-455`, **before** the `while (true)` at 626. They launch once; nothing monitors
   or relaunches them. Any companion death is a **silent permanent stop**. And `augfarmer.js`
   can't be relaunched on its own: the batcher fills home to `maxRam - HOME_RESERVE_GB`, so free
   RAM is pinned at 32 GB while it needs 64.1. Confirmed structural — home went **2 TB → 64 TB**
   and free RAM went *down* (34.75 GB → 32.00 GB), so "buy more RAM" is not a fix.
   - It did not block L7 (Kenneth was watching; `restart daemon.js` recovers — and that's
     exactly how the gap 5/6 fixes shipped mid-cycle).
   - It *does* block genuinely-unattended running, which is the actual prize (sleep ≈ no
     progress; 24/7 is a free ~2× lever). **With L7 closed, this is the only thing blocking it.**
   - **Fix is supervisor + reserve bump together, or neither.** The bump alone only helps a
     *human* relaunch. A supervisor alone would detect the death and then fail on RAM. Note
     Phase 25 deliberately declined the bump ("companions launch before the batcher packs
     home — restart daemon.js instead"), which was correct for the problem it addressed; the
     unattended-death case is what it didn't weigh.
3. **NFG counting / `daedalusGate`.** Install #5 answered S10's open question: queued NFG
   levels duplicate in `getOwnedAugmentations(true)` (queue 8 → 14), installed ones collapse
   to one entry. So `nfg.level` reads 1 forever (cosmetic), and `daedalusGate.installed`
   counts distinct augs. **CLOSED 2026-07-18 — the gate counts DISTINCT augs.** Answered by our
   own position rather than a test: post-install-#9 we hold **29 distinct augs and ~50 NFG
   levels**, with every *other* Daedalus requirement met (`$288t` ≥ $100b, hacking 4251 ≥ 2500,
   read live from `inviteReqs`) — and **no invite**. If levels counted individually we'd be far
   past 30 and already in. So `daedalusGate.installed`'s distinct count was right all along; we
   do **not** undercount, and there's no over-grind to correct.
   - Worth keeping: the earlier evidence (the 2026-07-15 clear at 33 distinct, install #6's
     8 → 15 move) was consistent with *both* readings and settled nothing. What settled it was a
     state where the two readings **predict different observable outcomes** — invited vs not.
     When a question stalls on ambiguous data, look for the position that forces a disagreement
     instead of collecting more of the same.

## Closed

### Gaps 5 and 6 — found by reading L7's logs, fixed the same day (`4b80da4`)

584 tests pass (6 new `pickNfgSeller` cases, incl. install #6's exact shape as a regression
fixture). `augfarmer.js` RAM **unchanged at 64.10 GB** (`getAugmentationPrice` was already
charged). Shipped live mid-cycle via `restart daemon.js` — necessary, because the spend-down
gap 6 protects runs in the *already-running* augfarmer, so waiting for the next install's
relaunch would have meant the next fire using the buggy code. **Both are now validated live:**
gap 5 by the `projected` field appearing on every `auto-aug` record, and gap 6 by installs #7
and #8 buying NFG from NiteSec and The Black Hand (highest rep) rather than CyberSec — see
"Done", below.

5. ~~**`recordTransaction` logged the PROJECTED price, not the price actually paid.**~~ The buy
   path recorded `amount: action.price`, which came from `spendDownPlan`'s own
   `price *= NFG_PRICE_LADDER` (1.9) projection rather than from the game. The real escalation
   is steeper (**since measured at 2.166**, see "Done" below), so **every NFG level after the
   first was under-logged, and the error compounded**: install #6's 11 levels logged **$417.7b**
   against a real spend of roughly **$2.2-2.7t**, a ~5-6× understatement. Money left the account
   correctly — only the *record* was wrong — but it silently corrupted `transactions-*.json`, the
   file the conventions say to validate against. **Fixed** by reading the live price immediately
   before the buy and logging that, keeping the projection alongside as `projected` — and it's
   exactly that `projected`-vs-`amount` pair that let the next fire measure the true ladder.
6. ~~**`nfgState.faction` picked `sellers[0]`, not the faction we hold the most rep with.**~~
   It took `catalog.augs[NFG].sellers[0]` — catalog order, i.e. CyberSec. NFG's rep requirement
   is the same whoever sells it, so the right pick is the joined faction with the **highest**
   rep. At install #6 that was **Chongqing (226,822)** but it bought from **CyberSec (54,690)**.
   It worked *that time* only because CyberSec's rep happened to clear NFG's 10,181 requirement —
   had it not, `repMet` would have been false, the entire NFG tail suppressed, and the whole
   $5.5t bank wasted on an install. **It worked by luck.** Fourth instance of this doc's
   recurring confusion — *"who sells it" ≠ "who we have rep with"*. **Fixed** by `pickNfgSeller`.
   - **It was a fresh coin-flip every cycle, not a one-off.** Installing resets faction rep to
     zero, so CyberSec had to *re-earn* 10,181 before every fire for the NFG tail to work at all.
     Fire early in a cycle, or in a cycle whose grind doesn't route through CyberSec, and the
     bank converts to nothing. The highest-rep faction is the camp one being actively worked, so
     picking by rep both removes the failure mode and buys more levels.
   - ~~Checked and **not** a factor: NFG's rep requirement does *not* climb with level. The
     catalog read 10,181 both before install #6 and after (fresh rebuild at 06:21:48), despite
     12 levels going in — so this was unguarded rather than worsening.~~ **WRONG — corrected
     2026-07-18, see gap 8.** It climbs **×1.14 per level**. That before/after read was a
     catalog that hadn't actually rebuilt. (NFG's *price* does scale: the catalog's base moved
     ~×4.23 ≈ 1.14¹¹ across the same install — which should have been the tell that its rep
     moves the same way.)

### Resolved by L7 itself

1. ~~**`MIN_TOTAL_GAIN` (1.1) is an unproven degenerate-loop guard.**~~ Still not stress-tested
   at the boundary, but its root cause is **fixed**. install #6 armed at 1.173 and delivered
   1.127 actual (1.632 → 1.839): the projection over-estimated because `nfgLevelsProjected`
   used a stale 1.9 ladder (and a `(L-1)` factor pinned to it), projecting 15 levels where 11
   were purchasable. Now that the ladder is measured (2.166) and the factor tracks it, the
   projection is honest — so `totalGain` no longer overstates a fire, and 1.1 means what it
   says. The remaining boundary question (does the guard actually stop a degenerate loop) still
   wants a real low-gain arm to exercise it, but that's a smaller open item than it was.
2. ~~**Observe-mode trigger flap.**~~ Confirmed live at a **10:21 cadence** and confirmed
   harmless under `auto` (the latch pre-empts it). Still degrades observe-mode evidence; the
   cheap fix is to treat `install-ready` as an arming phase in observe.

**Also settled — the stranded money is inherent, not a bug.** The install wiped **$2.455t**
unspent, which looks alarming and isn't: spend-down stops when the next NFG level costs more
than the remaining bank (live price had escalated past $2.94t), and every discrete aug left
had `deficit > 0` (rep not met), so there was genuinely nothing to buy. An exponential ladder
always strands up to one level's price. **Do not "fix" this.**

---

## Where the work went

**Nothing is left here.** Phase 25's own defects are closed; everything still live moved to
**`phase-26-ratchet-autonomy.features.md`** (repo root while active), which carries gaps 4, 8's
strategy half, 9, and 7's stall-age follow-on — plus the root cause all four share.

**Abort levers, unchanged and still valid:** set `ratchet-mode.txt` to anything but `auto`, or
create `augfarmer-pause.txt`.

## The one lesson worth carrying forward

Six separate bugs in this phase were **the same bug**: code that names a faction or an aug
without being clear which question it is answering — *what do we buy* / *what are we waiting on*
/ *what should the slot work* / *what unlocks a gate*. Three fixes widened which faction gets
picked; none asked what it means when the right answer is **none** (gap 7) or **something the
scorer values at zero** (gap 9).

The deeper version, and Phase 26's starting point: `score` is a single number doing four jobs,
and the engine has **no representation of what it is currently trying to achieve.** Every one of
these six was that absence surfacing somewhere new.

### Done since the first fire (2026-07-17 afternoon, installs #7-#8)

- **Two more auto-installs ran unattended, clean.** `mult.hacking` 1.839 → 2.482 (#7) → 3.555
  (#8); gate 15 → 24/30. Both fixes exercised: gap 6 bought NFG from **NiteSec** (#7) and **The
  Black Hand** (#8), not CyberSec — proving it now tracks the highest-rep faction cycle to cycle.
- **NFG ladder measured and set (`NFG_PRICE_LADDER` 1.9 → 2.166).** Install #8's 11-level run
  logged a dead-constant paid ratio of 2.166. The gap-5 fix's `projected` field made this a
  direct read: level 11 had been under-logged 3.71× (paid $2,150b vs projected $580b).
- **`nfgLevelsProjected` corrected (gap 1's root cause).** The projection's `(L-1)` numerator
  factor was the literal 0.9 — silently coupled to the old 1.9 ladder — so bumping the constant
  alone would have mis-projected; it's now `(NFG_PRICE_LADDER - 1)`. Validated: predicts 11 for
  install #8, matching reality (old formula said 13). Live projection dropped 17 → 14 on the
  restart, confirming the over-projection is gone. This makes `totalGain` honest, which makes
  `MIN_TOTAL_GAIN` behave as intended. Shipped mid-cycle via `restart daemon.js`; 584 tests pass.

## Pointers

- Design record + BN1.2 close-out → `phase-25-faction-strategy.spec.md` (the S11 correction is
  in its close-out; its "Live validation" section holds the original L7 checklist, now passed).
- Condensed history → `CHANGELOG.md` (2026-07-17).
- Live bugs/ideas → `BACKLOG.md`.
- Commits: `aeeb632` (horizon ← head), `b5b654d` (dashboard work line), `3feb4b4` (horizon
  counts passive), `902849a` (S11 record), `eb2a853` (reserve gap structural), `1e6d793`
  (NFG counting), `4b80da4` (gaps 5+6 fixed), `3439434` (NFG ladder measured 2.166 + projection
  fix).
- L7's raw evidence, install #6: `logs/ratchet-log.json` (last record — the `{pre, post}`
  pair), `logs/ratchet-decisions.json` (the `trigger-fire` → `install` chain),
  `logs/transactions-2026-07-17.json` (the 11 NFG buys).
  - **Reading that transaction file correctly matters.** Records written *before* 6:29 on
    2026-07-17 carry gap 5's bug — their `amount` is a projection, so install #6's NFG buys
    understate what was really paid by ~5-6×. Records from 6:29 onward carry a `projected`
    field beside `amount`; those are trustworthy, and the presence of that field is how you
    tell the two apart. Don't sum the file across that boundary and expect a real number.
  - The buys land in `transactions-*.json`, **not** in `ratchet-decisions.json` — decisions
    only record `spend-down-start`. Reading decisions alone makes a working spend-down look
    like it bought nothing; that misread cost this session a while.

## Tooling notes from the L7 sitting (2026-07-17)

Three things cost time here; none are obvious from the outside.

- **`cat <file>.txt` prints nothing in this build.** Not an error, not a modal — silently no
  output, even for a file with content. It reads exactly like an empty file and sent this
  session chasing a nonexistent save bug. Use `ls --grep <name>` to prove existence, and the
  consuming script's own state export to prove content.
- **The editor's Save button can't be reached by name.** It carries
  `aria-label="Ctrl + S or ⊞ + S"`, which *overrides* its accessible name, so
  `getByRole('button', {name: 'Save'})` never matches despite the visible text reading "Save".
  Match on visible text instead. (Prefer clicking it over sending Ctrl+S: if the app didn't
  capture the keystroke, Electron could raise a native save dialog, which CDP cannot see or
  dismiss — see the next point.)
- **Native OS dialogs are invisible to CDP.** Backup Save / Export Game open a Windows file
  picker, which is not in the DOM. Claude cannot see, fill, or cancel it — and clicking the
  button would leave a modal dialog blocking the game with no way to clear it. **Taking a save
  is Kenneth's step, not Claude's.**
